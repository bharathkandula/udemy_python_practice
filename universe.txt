Distant regions of space are assumed to exist and to be part of reality as much as we are, even though we can neverinteract with them. The spatial region that we can affect and be affected by is the observable universe. The observable universe depends on the location of the observer. By traveling, an observer can come into contact with a greaterregion of spacetime than an observer who remains still. Nevertheless, even the most rapid traveler will not be ableto interact with all of space. Typically, the observable universe is taken to mean the portion of the Universe thatis observable from our vantage point in the Milky Way.
